# TF2 Configuration files

These are the TF2 configuration files I use. They may not be particularly useful for you, but then again, you might want to look around.

## Layout

I'm trying to make things modular here and reuse ad much as possible through exec, in particular, I want to keep
the classname.cfg and autoexec.cfg as clean as possible.

common.cfg is set up to "undo" any of the things that the individual class configs might do, and is invoked at the top
of each class.cfg file.

## What's here?

* rocketjump.cfg - basic rocketjump script that doesn't require the use of wait - just look down, click mouse2, and
go flying.
* mwheel configs - changes the next/previous mousewheel functions to directly acccess primary/secondary/melee weapons.
