// Mousewheel slot bindings for only primary and melee 
// Usage: mousewheel up for primary, mousewheel down for melee, middle click for melee
// This helps to keep from cycling past the weapon you want when quick switching.
// This will also prevent you from accidently bringing up the build or destroy PDA in the middle
// of battle when you are trying to kill that spy that just sapped your buildings...
// This is appropriate when your secondary is not selectable, or is something you don't want to accidently
// select (it can still be selected with number key).


// unbind first in case anything else is using our bindings.
