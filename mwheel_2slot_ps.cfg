// Mousewheel slot bindings for primary and secondary only. 
// Usage: mousewheel up for primary, mousewheel down for secondary, middle click for secondary
// This helps to keep from cycling past the weapon you want when quick switching.
// This will also prevent you from accidently bringing up the build or destroy PDA in the middle
// of battle when you are trying to kill that spy that just sapped your buildings...
// This leaves off the melee so you have to use the number keys for it, appropriate for an honorbound
// weapon that can't be unselected until it gets a kill.

// unbind first in case anything else is using our bindings.
