// Mousewheel slot bindings
// Usage: mousewheel up for primary, mousewheel down for secondary, middle click for melee
// This helps to keep from cycling past the weapon you want when quick switching.
// This will also prevent you from accidently bringing up the build or destroy PDA in the middle
// of battle when you are trying to kill that spy that just sapped your buildings...


// unbind first in case anything else is using our bindings.
